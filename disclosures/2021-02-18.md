# Incident disclosure 2021-02-18

## Summary

- yveCRV[[1]](#References) weekly reward claim was frontrun by an external account, with rewards amounting 197,086 3Crv[[2]](#References) ultimately ending up in y3Crv vault.
- An unsuccessful attempt to recover rewards was made. It was frontrun by y3Crv vault harvest[[7]](#References) which has appropriated the available balance, increasing the y3Crv share price by approximately 0.27%.
- To not incur loss for recent y3Crv depositors, Yearn has decided to send 197,086 3Crv to yveCRV from the treasury[[3]](#References).

## Background

- On 2021-02-18, a direct call[[4]](#References) was made to Curve's `FeeDistributor` contract in order to claim fees on behalf of yveCRV.
- The design of `StrategyProxy`[[5]](#References) relied on all fees being claimed though yveCRV interaction, and so did not identify the increase in balance in order to claim it.
- The issue was quickly identified and an attempt[[6]](#References) to recover the funds was made via the multisig.
- Before the recovery could be completed, a keep3r call[[7]](#References) to harvest the `y3CRV` vault was made.
- The harvest action did not expect or account for a pre-existing balance of `3CRV` and so interpreted the unclaimed fees as belonging to the vault.
- The fees were deposited into the `3CRV` gauge and absorbed into the balance of `y3CRV`.

## Details of Incident

The root cause of the incident was the fee claiming action made by an external account. This was unexpected behaviour, causing incorrect actions by both `StrategyProxy` and `y3CRV` allowing the funds belonging to one vault end up in another vault's balance sheet.

- `StrategyProxy` did not account for the unguarded nature of Curve's `FeeDistributor.claim` method. It assumed that a claim action was only possible by a call from itself and did not check for any pre-existing balance of `3CRV`.
- `y3CRV` did not expect a pre-existing balance of `3CRV` when harvesting and assumed that any balance belonged to itself.

## Details of Fix

- `StrategyProxy` has been modified[[6]](#References) to check for and correctly handle a pre-existing balance of `3CRV` within the `CurveYCRVVoter` contract[[9]](#References).
