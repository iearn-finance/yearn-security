# Incident disclosure 2021-04-02

## Summary

1. A flaw in **StrategyMakerYFIDAIDelegate** circuit breaker and accounting logic has caused it to report free balance as profit.
2. A fix has been produced and the Strategy has been migrated. The excess fees have been donated back to the Vault, resulting in **no change to share price**.
3. **StrategyMakerETHDAIDelegate**, which uses the same template, has also been migrated, although it has not been affected by this incident.

## Background

1. **StrategyMakerYFIDAIDelegate** uses collateral to open a MakerDAO vault, draw DAI and delegate it to yvDAI.
2. MakerDAO uses a debt ceiling instant access module[[1]](#References), which allows anyone to adjust the debt ceiling. The strategy does that prior to deposits to make space for drawing up to 5 million DAI.
3. A large deposit has revealed a flaw in the circuit breaker and accounting logic, which has skipped depositing the collateral when there was no DAI to be drawn.

## Details of Incident

A large deposit of 428 YFI was made[[2]](#References) a few days ago. Part of it went into **StrategyMakerYFIDAIDelegate** on the next harvest[[3]](#References) but wasn't fully utilized, as there was no DAI available to draw in MakerDAO and the deposit function short-circuited.

The subsequent harvest[[4]](#References) has reported the free 295.8 YFI balance as profit, causing 58.1 yvYFI in fees taken out and the share price to dip and then to shoot up. The dip was caused by the fees, which are applied immediately, and the subsequent surge was caused by profits, which are gradually released over six hours.

The issue is caused by two factors:

1. Incorrect accounting assumption that the Strategy cannot have free assets, which it has reported as profit[[5]](#References) in `prepareReturn`.
2. Incorrect circuit breaker logic in `_deposit` which has skipped[[6]](#References) depositing collateral in MakerDAO if there was no DAI to be drawn, which could happen when the debt ceiling is reached.

## Details of Fix

Code changes between previous and fixed Strategies[[7]](#References).

1. `prepareReturn` now tracks the delta of `want.balanceOf(this)` as profit. This prevents pre-existing free balance to be reported as profit.
2. `prepareReturn` also checks `vault.strategies(this).totalDebt` versus `estimatedTotalAssets`. This has correctly offset the erroneously reported profit as realized loss after the Strategy was migrated.
3. `_deposit` always deposits collateral if it has any and only skips yvDAI deposit if the drawn DAI amount is zero. This prevents the Strategy from ending up with loose collateral.

## Timeline of events

1. **Apr 01, 2021 20:39 (UTC)** A harvest injects the Strategy with loose YFI[[3]](#References).
2. **Apr 02, 2021 21:16** Strategy reports free balance as profits[[4]](#References).
3. **21:25** A user reports negative APY for the yvYFI vault on yearn.vision[[7]](#References), and the Yearn team begins to investigate.
4. **21:54** Strategy is removed from Keep3r job[[8]](#References) to prevent further harvests.
5. **23:33** A code fix is prepared[[9]](#References).
6. **23:49** A fixed Strategy is deployed[[10]](#References).
7. **Apr 03 00:05** YFI Strategy is successfully migrated[[11]](#References), MakerDAO position is shifted[[12]](#References) to the new Strategy, fees tallying 59.3 YFI are donated to yvYFI.
8. **00:31** A similar fixed WETH Strategy is deployed[[13]](#References).
9. **00:42** WETH Strategy is successfully migrated[[14]](#References), inheriting the Maker position[[15]](#References).
10. **00:51** Both strategies are authorized[[16]](#References) in Maker oracle security module proxies.
11. **01:00** Both strategies added to TendV2Keep3rJob[[17]](#References).

## Third Party Disclosure

As per Yearn's security process document[[18]](#References), the project does not currently have any established bilateral disclosure agreements. In line with our security policy, no disclosure has therefore been made to third parties prior to to this publication.
