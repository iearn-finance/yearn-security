# Incident disclosure 2021-05-13

## Summary

- A missing check in low-level call in `StrategyProxy` has lead to non-atomic execution of withdrawal transaction.
- This resulted in transactions burning the shares but not performing the actual withdrawal when supplied with insufficient gas.
- No funds were lost. Four users of crvAAVE vault have suffered from this issue. This has been remediated and the users have been made whole.
- A new `StrategyProxy` has been deployed.

## Background

All Curve strategies indirectly interact with Yearn's `CurveYCRVVoter`[[1]](#References) contract to perform operations like `deposit` and `withdraw` against Curve gauges. For safety, these interactions are proxied through an access controlled `StrategyProxy`[[2]](#References) contract.

A partially failed withdrawal attempt has revealed a flaw in the logic of `StrategyProxy` which may prevent underlying funds from being returned to the user in some scenarios.

## Details of Incident

Calls between `StrategyProxy` and `CurveYCRVVoter` use a low-level call function[[3]](#References) that returns either `true` or `false` to indicate if the call was successful.

While `StrategyProxy` checks that the call was successful during `deposit` function calls (see 2020-09-25 disclosure[[4]](#References)), it was discovered that this same check is not performed during `withdraw`[[5]](#References) function calls. This leads to an undesirable scenario when the transaction can succeed despite a failure in the branched call to `CurveYCRVVoter`. The result is user's vault shares are burned with zero funds withdrawn from vault to user.

The branched call has failed due to an "*out of gas*" error (see example transaction[[6]](#References)). 

This error may have been caused by the higher amount of gas needed to claim the new `stkAAVE` token rewards from the two Curve gauges which have recently added them: `crvAAVE` and `crvSAAVE`. We have not seen this same "*out of gas*" failure on other gauges.

In total, four `crvAAVE` users were impacted during an attempted withdraw, incurring a temporary loss to the user. The `crvSAAVE` vault users were unaffected.

These transactions also led to a temporary `pricePerFullShare` increase due to burned shares not returning the commensurate amount of underlying funds to users.

## Details of Fix

All `VoterProxy.execute` calls in `StrategyProxy` have now use a `safeExecute` library function which checks the call didn't revert. This ensures atomicity of transactions involving the proxy[[7]](#References).

Vault share price has been brought back down by withdrawing the excess funds from gauge and returning them to the affected users.

A short-term fix in the UI has been implemented to provide all users attempting a withdraw with a sufficient gas limit.

## Timeline of events
1. **May 14, 2021 00:52 (UTC)** Discord user reports a total loss on their withdraw transaction[[6]](#References) from yva3CRV vault.
3. **01:08** Root cause is identified in **StrategyProxy**.
4. **04:47** The proxy address is set to zero address on **StrategyCurvea3CRVVoterProxy**, restricting withdraws from and deposits to the affected Strategy[[8]](#References).
5. **04:48** The exact amount lost is withdrawn from the gauge, price per share is fixed[[9]](#References).
6. **05:32** The proxy address is reset back on **StrategyCurvea3CRVVoterProxy**[[10]](#References).
6. **05:34** Users are reimbursed, deployment of funds into Strategy is temporarily paused using `setMin(0)` on the Vault[[11]](#References).
7. **05:38** A frontend fix bumping the withdrawal gas limit to 2 million gas for all Curve vaults is implemented.
8. **06:02** A fix for `StrategyProxy` is created and proposed [[7]](#References).
9. **12:25** A new **StrategyProxy** contract is deployed [[12]](#References).
10. **16:01** `CurveYCRVVoter` is switched to a new `StrategyProxy`, all 31 Curve strategies are approved and switched to it[[13]](#References).

## Third Party Disclosure

As per Yearn's security process document[[14]](#References), the project does not currently have any established bilateral disclosure agreements. In line with our security policy, no disclosure has therefore been made to third parties prior to to this publication.
