# Incident disclosure 2021-05-14

## Summary
- A method `SingleSidedCrvDAI` used to estimate its assets has led the strategy to believe it had suffered losses.
- yvDAI v2 vault experienced a temporary share price dip during the incident.
- No funds were lost and the share price has been restored after the strategy was migrated.

## Background

`SingleSidedCrvDAI` strategy deposits DAI into the `ib3CRV` pool on Curve and then deposits that into another Yearn vault. The Curve pool contains cyDAI, cyUSDT and cyUSDC. 

The value of the strategy's position is calculated in the `estimatedTotalAssets` function. It aims to return the total value that could *actually* be obtained from the strategy if it were to divest its entire position based on the current on-chain conditions.

It does this by simulating a withdrawal of all assets from the Curve pool back to DAI. As the strategy grew over time the size of this simulation increased until it was simulating a single 85,270,663 DAI withdrawal. Behind the scenes this is equivalent of selling a very large amount of USDT and USDC in a single trade which would cause a large loss.

## Details of Incident

A loss of 4,932,713 DAI was incorrectly reported during the `harvest` function call[[1]](#References) which updates the vault's profit and loss figures. This amount is equivalent to the slippage of a single-sided 85.27 million DAI withdrawal.

This was a paper loss as the trade didn't happen. It was a simulation to determine how much DAI would be returned if all funds were divested at once.

## Details of Fix

`estimatedTotalAssets` function was changed to report assets based on virtual price of the Curve pool rather than the realisable value[[2]](#References).

The first `harvest` of the fixed strategy has offset the paper loss and reported a 5,332,803 DAI profit[[3]](#References).
